# NodeJS Chatroom with Express and SQLite

Welcome to the NodeJS Chatroom project! This simple chat application is built using Node.js, Express, and SQLite for data storage. It provides a basic platform for users to join a chat room, send messages, and engage in real-time communication.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can create accounts and log in to the chatroom.
- **Chat Rooms**: A chat room is available for users to join.
- **Real-time Messaging**: Messages are sent and received in real-time using WebSocket (via `socket.io`).
- **Persistent Storage**: Chat messages are stored in an SQLite database, ensuring data persistence.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/emanzie/chatroom.git
    cd chatroom
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    npm install
    ```

3. Set up the SQLite database:

    navigate to `http://localhost:3000/init`

4. Start the application:

    ```bash
